       AheadOn is a smart, lightweight web application that helps users explore fascinating places around the world with just a city name. It’s your virtual travel companion for discovering local attractions such as historical monuments, nature parks, cultural landmarks, and architectural wonders. AheadOn uses real-time data powered by the "Geoapify" and "OpenTripMap" APIs to provide an immersive exploration experience for users who love travel, learning, and discovery.

Whether you're a tourist planning your next adventure or a student exploring the globe, AheadOn is designed to be fast, visual, and easy to use.

Features:

-  Enter any city to explore popular nearby attractions
-  Shows cultural, natural, architectural, and tourist POIs
-  Displays image previews of each place
-  Includes short descriptions via Wikipedia extracts
-  Directly links to Google Maps for navigation
-  Built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

How It Works:

1. The user enters a city name.
2. The app uses the Geoapify API to convert the city name into geographic coordinates.
3. It then sends those coordinates to the OpenTripMap API to fetch nearby interesting places within a 10km radius.
4. For each place, detailed data is fetched — including name, image, and a short description.
5. Results are shown as interactive cards with a “View More” button that reveals full details and a map link.

 Technologies Used:

- HTML5 & CSS – For page structure and basic design
- JavaScript – To handle dynamic behavior and API calls
- Geoapify API – Converts city names to geographic coordinates
- OpenTripMap API – Fetches places and attraction details

 How to Use:

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Search for any city in the UI (or use the searchCity function via input).
4. Results will load below with images and buttons.
5. (Optional) Replace API keys in `main.js` with your own for production use.
